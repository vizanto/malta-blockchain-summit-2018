## Malta Blockchain Summit 2018 Hackathon submission

See `Solidity` for our smart contract and `Dashboard` for the Community manager mockup.

## Inspiration
There are many areas where local communities struggle, in many cases all over the world has been proven that local currencies can help to kickstart their economy again, the blockchain can bring transparency, privacy, and real decentralization to their economies

## What it does
We empower community managers to kickstart the economy of their communities by issuing their own tokens, in order to favor local activities, we also empower them to promote sustainable behaviour. Our system also looks on the other end at commercial organizations by providing them with the means to increase their customer loyalty in a transparent and readily GDPR compliant fashion

## How we built it
We used bootstrap for the dashboard and Web3 API for connecting to Ethereum and call the contract to issue tokens. As for the blockchain layer our smart contract runs on the Ethereum network and is written in solidity. It generates a non fungible token at the current moment based on the ERC721 specification

## What's next for blocal
Our vision is to support any kind of communities by providing them with payment, distribution, promotion, gamification and marketing means needed to get them started
